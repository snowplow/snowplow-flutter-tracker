/// To define your own custom self-describing event, you must create a JSON schema for that event and upload it to an [Iglu Schema Repository](https://github.com/snowplow/iglu) using [igluctl](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/open-source-components-and-applications/iglu/) (or if a Snowplow BDP customer, you can use the [Snowplow BDP Console UI](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/understanding-tracking-design/managing-data-structures/) or [Data Structures API](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/understanding-tracking-design/managing-data-structures-via-the-api-2/)).
